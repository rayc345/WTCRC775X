# WTCRC775X

此项目为矿石收音机论坛中帖子“自己控制车机之第四部曲——福克斯AHU1005”所涉及的程序源代码
帖子参考地址：http://www.crystalradio.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=1678881

经过三四年半开源后，考虑源码拥有人数已经很多，且程序内包含的示例密钥并没有商用价值，与NXP的企业权益无冲突，此外由于学业/事业较为繁忙，难有时间前往论坛逐一回复，我决定彻底开源，将此仓库由私有改为公开。

此仓库内程序适用于SAF7751/7753/7754/7755/7758 204/205/207/208。

关于项目任何疑问或者合理需求，可以直接在本项目中发表Issue，欢迎提交PR

This repository contains source code for the 'NXP SAF775X DIY' public project which supports SAF7751/7753/7754/7755/7756/7758 204/205/207/208 variants,
Demostration keycodes for several SAF775X variants are contained in the source code that's why this project was not fully open-source but uses a request-and-give source code mode.

It's now four years after initial release. A lot of people already have the full source code. Considering the demo-keycode does not pose any threat to business interests of NXP since it's provided by NXP free of charge for evaluation purposes.

Besides, I don't have enough time to talk to everyone interested in. So I decide to make this source code repository publicly availble.
If you have any question concerning the usage of this chip or other matters, please let my know. You can directly create a new issure in this repository. All issues would be inspected in detail. Pull requests are welcodem.
